This is a bookmarklet used to unblur obfuscated content such as phone numbers, email addresses, etc. It can be used for search results on sites like thatsthem, Intelius, zabasearch, etc.
To use it, create a bookmark in your toolbar, in the name field, use "unblur" in the URL field paste the code, and save. Then, when you encounter blurred content within your search results,
you can simply click the bookmarklet in your toolbar and the content will be revealed. This has only been tested on the websites mentioned above but has the potential to work on other 
websites as well. More info at https://denniskeefe.me/tools/
